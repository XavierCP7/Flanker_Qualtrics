Eriksen Flanker Task to be administer through Qualtrics

The flanker task is a popular task to measure response inhibition. In the variant presented here, participants are required to judge whether an arrow presented between four other arrows is pointing in the same or the opposite direction by pressing a key on the keyboard. We will create a 16-trial long version of this task which provides feedback on the participant's performance at the end of the experiment.
